In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about country and city data. 

1. List all attributes for American cities with a population greater than 100,000.
SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE population > 100000 AND COUNTRYCODE = "USA";

2. List all American cities with a population greater than 120,000.
SELECT name
FROM CITY
WHERE population > 120000 AND COUNTRYCODE = "USA";

3. Generate the every attribute from the CITY table.
SELECT *
FROM CITY;

4. List all  attributes for ID 1661.
SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE ID = 1661;

5. List all attributes for every Japanese city.
SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = "JPN";

6. List all cities in Japan.
SELECT name
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = "JPN";

7. How many cities have a Population larger than 100,000?
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM CITY
WHERE population > 100000;

8. What is the total population of all cities California?
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = "California";

9. What is the average population of all cities California?
SELECT AVG(population)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = "California";

10. What is the the average population for all cities, rounded down to the nearest integer?
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(population))
FROM CITY;

11. What is the total population for all Japanese cities?
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = "JPN";

12. What is the difference between the smallest and largest city populations?
SELECT (max(population)-min(population))
FROM CITY;

13. What is the total population of all cities on the continent Asia?
SELECT SUM(city.population)
FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE=COUNTRY.CODE
WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = "Asia";

14. List the names of all cities on the continent Africa.
SELECT CITY.NAME
FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE=COUNTRY.CODE
WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = "Africa";

15. List  the names of all the continents and their respective average city populations rounded down to the nearest integer.
SELECT COUNTRY.CONTINENT, FLOOR(avg(CITY.POPULATION))
FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE=COUNTRY.CODE
GROUP BY COUNTRY.CONTINENT;
