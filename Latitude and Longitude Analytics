1. List all cities next to their respective states.
SELECT CITY,STATE
FROM STATION;

2. List the sum of all the values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places next to all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
SELECT ROUND((sum(lat_N)),2),ROUND((sum(long_W)),2)
FROM STATION;

3. List all cities with an even ID number.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE MOD(ID,2)=0 ORDER BY CITY;

4. What is the difference between the number of city entries and the number of distinct city entries?
SELECT (Count(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT CITY))
FROM STATION;

5. List the cities with the longest and shortest names next to their respective lengths.
SELECT CITY, length(CITY)
FROM STATION 
WHERE length(CITY)=(SELECT max(length(CITY))FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY LIMIT 1
UNION
SELECT CITY, length(CITY)
FROM STATION 
WHERE length(CITY)=(SELECT min(length(CITY))FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY LIMIT 1;

6. List the city names starting with vowels, excluding duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(city,1) IN ("a","e","i","o","u");

7. List the city names ending with vowels, excluding duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) IN ("a","e","i","o","u");

8. List the city names both beginning and ending with vowels, excluding duplicates.

FROM STATION
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) IN ("a","e","i","o","u")
AND LEFT(city,1) IN ("a","e","i","o","u");

9. List the city names that do not start with vowels, excluding duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(city,1) NOT IN ("a","e","i","o","u");


10. List the city names that do not end with vowels, excluding duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) NOT IN ("a","e","i","o","u");


11. List the city names that either do not begin or do not end with vowels, excluding duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(city,1) NOT IN ("a","e","i","o","u")
OR RIGHT(city,1) NOT IN ("a","e","i","o","u");

12. List the city names that neither begin nor end with vowels, excluding duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(city,1) NOT IN ("a","e","i","o","u")
AND RIGHT(city,1) NOT IN ("a","e","i","o","u");

13. What is the sum of Northern Latitudes that have values greater than 38.770 and less than 137.2345, rounded to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N BETWEEN 38.7880 AND 137.2345;

14. What is the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes that is less than 137.2345, rounded to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(MAX(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345;

15. What is the Western Longitude for the largest Northern Latitude that is less than 137.2345, rounded to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION

FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N IN (SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780);

17. What is the Western Longitude where the smallest Northern Latitude is greater than 38.7780, rounded to 4 decimal places.

FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N IN (SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780);

18. What is the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
        P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) are two points on a 2d plane. a=MIN(LAT_N) b=MIN(LONG_W) c=MAX(LAT_N) d=MAX(LONG_W)
SELECT
ROUND((MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N))+(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W)),4)
FROM STATION;
